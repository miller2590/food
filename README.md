# React Native Food App
This is my first application on react native. It is a food searching application.

## Purpose
The purpose of this app was to practice react native functionality.
This app was made along side a native tutorial.

## Yelp
To run this application, you will need a yelp api key. You will need to create a .env file in the root directory and place your key there.
